* runbld changes
** 1.5.13
   - add =JAVA_HOME/bin= to the =PATH= of the wrapped process.
** 1.5.12
   - prefer a non-default =branch_specifier= environment variable over
     =--last-good-commit= when choosing which commit/branch to pull
** 1.5.11
   - Hide the empty line when there is no text to display in the Slack
     message
   - Add the start time when we initially add the build to ES.
** 1.5.10
   - Reduce number of shards to 2
   - Rework the slack notifications more visually pleasant and concise
** 1.5.9
   - Retry assertion failures when calling Facter
   - Improve error message when runbld is run from the wrong directory
     and cannot find the VCS info
   - Fix a bug with looking up environment variables
   - Add a runbld docker file for runbld testing
** 1.5.8
   - Add retries around gathering system facts
   - Add another exception to the list that we ignore when attempting
     to determine if the host is an EC2 node.
** 1.5.7
   - Small bugfix to make sure that the =first-success= setting takes
     precedence over =success= (i.e., no need to set =success= to
     false to make =first-success= work)
** 1.5.6
   - Parse the job name by splitting on + rather than via regex
** 1.5.5
   - Parse git commits that are GPG-signed, but the signature doesn't include
     header information.
** 1.5.4
   - Search for =build_metadata= files in the root execution directory
     (Java's =user.dir=) rather than from the wrapped script's
     execution directory.
** 1.5.3
   - Add =basedir= option to scm config to allow source to be checked
     out into a subdirectory relative to the current working directory
     of the script.
   - Tweak the HTML email template to turn the =build.console-url=
     into a real link
   - Fix the MIME format of the email to properly separate the
     multipart/alternative email bodies (html and plain text) from the
     attachments using multipart/mixed
** 1.5.2
   - always set build_metadata when it's passed in via the env
** 1.5.1
   - add ';' between concatenated metadata files
** 1.5.0
   - Add ability to store/restore build metadata.  The wrapped script
     may write out files whose name start with =build_metadata= and
     the contents of those files will be concatenated and stored in
     ES.  Future executions for the job will restore the metadata into
     an environment variable named =BUILD_METADATA=

** 1.3.8
   - Update and switch branches (if needed) an already cloned repo
     when SCM is specified
** 1.3.7
